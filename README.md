## Key Objectives

### 1. Data Cleaning and Quality Assessment
The dataset was initially inconsistent and corrupted due to database pipeline issues and encoding errors.  
To ensure data reliability, I conducted a thorough data quality assessment and executed extensive cleaning tasks, including:
- Identifying and handling missing values.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Correcting incorrectly formatted data.
